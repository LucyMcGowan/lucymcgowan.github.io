title: "dplyr Thank You Notes"
---

It's that post-holiday time of year to write some thank yous! I'm getting excited to attend rstudio::conf next week, so in that spirit, I have put together a little thank you using `dplyr`.
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
require(dplyr)
```

```{r}
dear <-function(input, you="you"){
  cat(input, "\nDear ", you,",", sep = "")
}
thank_you <- function(input, for_the = "gift"){
  cat(input, "\n Thank you for the", for_the)
}

personaltouch <- function(input, pt = "I hope you have a lovely New Year!"){
  cat(input, pt)
}

from <- function(input, us = "us"){
  cat(input, "\n Cheers,\n", us)
}
```


```{r}
"A Thank You Note" %>%
  dear(you = "R Studio") %>%
  thank_you(for_the = "opportunity to attend rstudio::conf.") %>%
  personaltouch(pt = "We are SO looking forward to learning from and with you all.") %>%
  from(us = "Lucy, Jacquelyn, and Alli")
```
