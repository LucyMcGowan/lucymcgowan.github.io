*This was inspired by Hilary Parker & Roger Peng's Not So Standard Deviations Episode 28, which can be found [here](https://soundcloud.com/nssd-podcast/episode-28-writing-is-a-lot-harder-than-just-talking). It was suggested that it would be useful to lay out Hill's criterion for data scientists, I agree!*

<br>
Sir Austin Bradford Hill, a statistician and epidemiologist, created a list of guidelines for evaluating whether there is evidence of a causal relationship.[1] He determined the following aspects of associations ought to be considered when assessing causality. When thinking about this problem, an [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/) comic I have seen in *every lecture* on this topic came to mind:

<br>

This inspired me to attempt to explain Hill's criteria using xkcd comics (bear with me, some of these are a stretch üôàüíÅüèª). 



<br>

### Strength

* How big is the effect you are seeing?
* Note: Hill suggests that huge effects *can* suggest causality, however this does not mean small effects *cannot*

### Consistency

* This is essentially [reproducibility](http://kbroman.org/steps2rr/) & replicability
* Can your analysis be reproduced?
* Has anyone been able to replicate your findings?

<br>

### Specificity

* Can the association be pinpointed to a specific cause with no other plausible explanation?
* I appreciate Hill's caveat here, *"if specificity exists we may be able to draw conclusions without hesitation; if it is not apparent, we are not thereby necessarily left sitting irresolutely on the fence."*

<br>

### Temporality

* Does the timeline make sense? 
* In general, the exposure ought to come before the outcome it is said to cause.

### Biological gradient

* The wording of this point makes it a bit difficult to untangle from the medical application, but generally this refers to a dose effect
* Does increasing an exposure yield a change in the outcome.

<br>

### Plausibility

* Does the causal relationship make sense?
* *This is also a tricky one since plausibility depends on knowledge at the time. If we found it perfectly plausible, we may not need statistics to show the relationship.*

<br>

### Coherence

* Similar to plausibility, is there a logical argument that can be made by/to experts in the field regarding causality.
* Does it fit into the understanding of the field (*authors note*: this should have caveats too...the field could be wrong).

<br>

### Experiment

* If a controlled experiment can take place, this can strengthen the argument for causality 
* I view this as a general attempt to implement a counterfactual analysis.

### Analogy

* Have we seen a similar effect from a similar exposure?
